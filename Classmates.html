    I didn't really talk to people in our class but what I found from listening to them is they enjoy a wide variety of things!

 Things such as.....
 <ul>

<p>
    Posting meme's in the slack channel that get everyone involved,sometimes even the proffesor! 
</p>
<p>
    So much so that recently there was over 20 meme's posted about 'brazllian pizza' that took up 3 pages of the slack general chat.

     Though I didn't talk to the people in our class everyone seemed friendly and happy to talk and help out on and other.
