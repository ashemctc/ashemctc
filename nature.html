<p>
Here are some things in the natural world that interest me!
</p>


I enjoy and appreciate aspects of nature like...
 <ul>

  <li>
 <h1 class ="heading">Great Barrier Reef</h1> </li>

<p>
    The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system that stretches over 1,400 miles off the coast of Ausralia.
</p>
<p>
    The reef itself is so large in size it can be seen from outer space, and considered the largest single structure made by living organisms.
</p>
  <h1 class="heading" style="background-color:rgba(99, 245, 221, 0.726);"></h1>

 <li>

 <h2 class ="heading">Red Panda's</h2>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5EnfIXS.jpg" alt="Red Panda's"style="width:700px;height:500px;">
 <p>
     I chose Red Pands as something in nature I like simply because to me, they're the closet thing we have to 'Pokemon' being as cute as they are.

 </p>
<p>
    Red Panda's are native to the Himalayas and southwestern China and currently listed as Endangered with a wild population of (estimated) 10,000 or less. Due to Habitat loss poaching and other factors.
   
</p>
<p>
    Curious little creatures the Red Panda is a territorial animal and mostly solitary expect during mating season. They are fairly quiet expect for some twittering, tweeting and other forms of whistling sounds for comummincation.

</li>

 <li>

 <h3 class= "heading" >Aurora Borealis</h3>

<p>
    Finally just due to its beauty I chose to showcase the Aurora Borealis as something in nature I think is interesting.

</p>
<p>
    It is a natural light display in the Earth's sky and is predominantly seen in the high-lattitude regions such as the Artic and the Antarctic.
